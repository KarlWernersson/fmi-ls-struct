[![Build Specification](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct/actions/workflows/build-ls-struct.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct/actions/workflows/build-ls-struct.yml)

This repository contains a current prototype draft for the FMI Layered Standard for structuring of variables (fmi-ls-struct) based on the [Functional Mock-up Interface][FMI].

Based on FMI 3.0, this layered standard defines how variables (especially parameters) of an FMU can be structured and grouped in a more flexible way than with the "structured naming convention" of the FMI Standard. The first version of this layered standard is focused on the definition of sampled maps.

The [FMI 3.0 Layered Standard for structuring of variables][spec] is currently maintained on [GitHub][githubspec] and is published [here][spec]. It is
based on the [FMI][] standard.
